    Scenario Outline: User who has entered a valid code from Data Table Z Only, and has selected IA variation type, is directed to 'Confirm Change Variation' page 
        Given the user has been directed to the 'Confirm Change Variation' page
        When page 'Confirm Change Variation' loads
        Then they will see a 'Back' link
        And a 'Sign out' link
        And a sub header 'Vary a marketing variation'
        And a page header 'Are you sure you want to change variation: variation: variation:'
        And they will see the 'Variation <Sub Code>' displayed 
        And they will see a radio button option for 'Yes'
        And they will see a radio button option for 'No'
        And they will see a 'Continue' option
